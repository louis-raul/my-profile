      <p>
        Currently a first year student at ESSEC, I am developing my skills in marketing, economics, languages but also in programming. In three words, I would describe myself as dynamic, enthusiastic and curious.

      <h2>Open to the world and foreign cultures</h2>
      <p>
        Learning languages has always attracted me: I have been learning German since primary school, English since middle school, learning Chinese since the fifth grade of which I obtained the HSK2 and Spanish in LV3 since my entrance to ESSEC. Aware of the importance of English, I chose alongside my studies to pursue a double course in order to pass the ‚ÄúHigh school diploma‚Äù, or the American baccalaureate. During these studies, I was able to discover the history of the United States, the organization of institutions, the functioning of the government but also their economic system. In addition, I was able to develop my digital and methodological skills during this program.

      <h2>Passionate about music</h2>
      <p>
        My passion for music has played a key role in my personal development. Having practiced the piano for 12 years at the music conservatory, last year I chose to perform a recital in collaboration with other artists. The rigor, perseverance and work necessary to study the piano have brought me method, balance and personal development. Also, I was able to develop collaborative work at the conservatory during my chamber music sessions. In my opinion, music takes on its full meaning through sharing. Finally, I gave lessons to young beginner pianists in order to pass on my passion and help them overcome their difficulties.

      <h2>Passionate about sport</h2>
      <p>
        Practicing fencing, skiing and swimming allowed me to develop my tenacity and my ability to surpass myself. This year, I pursued this passion by joining the ESSEC rowing club. Through these sports, I learned to overcome obstacles and persevere in my efforts, qualities which are essential to me today to achieve my professional ambitions.
